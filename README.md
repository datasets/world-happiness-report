# World Happiness Report

World Happiness Report data and information.

## Data

ðŸš§ In progress. Trying to find ... bulk version 

## License

Unclear though they state the data is "public" (2024-07-05):

> Our work is public. Data for Figure 2.1 for each corresponding year are freely downloadable. The survey measure of SWB (Subjective Well-being) is from the Gallup World Poll (GWP). Please reference the report accordingly (see Citation).

No obvious raw data in bulk to download. It's bitty.
